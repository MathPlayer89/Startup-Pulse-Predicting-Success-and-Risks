# Startup Pulse: Predicting Success and Risks
A data science project analyzing startup dynamics through predictive modeling and clustering techniques

# Project Description
This project delves into the dynamics of startup success and failure using the **Startup Failure Prediction Dataset** sourced from Kaggle. Through data analysis, classification models, and clustering techniques, we aim to uncover the key factors that influence whether a startup thrives or collapses. This project is designed to showcase business-oriented insights and predictive strategies, adding value to the decision-making process for entrepreneurs and investors.

# Objectives
- **Classification**: Predict whether a startup is likely to succeed or fail based on attributes like funding, burn rate, and product uniqueness.
- **Clustering**: Group startups by shared characteristics (e.g., revenue brackets, risk factors) to identify patterns across industries.
- **Insights**: Provide actionable insights into success drivers, financial trends, and entrepreneurial strategies.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information on 5,000 startups across industries, with the following features:
- **Industry**: Type of business (e.g., Tech, Healthcare, E-commerce).
- **Startup Age**: Number of years the startup has been running.

- **Employees Count**: Number of employees in the startup.
- **Revenue**: Revenue generated by the startup.
- **Burn Rate**: Monthly expenditure by the startup.
- **Market Size**: Size of the industry (Small, Medium, Large).
- **Business Model**: Business to Business (B2B), Business to Customer (B2C), or mix of both (Hybrid).
- **Product Uniqueness Score**: Scale from 1â€“10 assessing product innovation.
- **Customer Retention Rate**: Percentage of returning customers.
- **Marketing Expense**: Amount spent on marketing.
- **Startup Status**: Binary outcome: 1 = Successful, 0 = Failed.
